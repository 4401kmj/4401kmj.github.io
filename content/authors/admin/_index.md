#     summary: |
#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me
Hi, My name is Minjun Kang. I graduated from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) with a BSÂ in Bio and Brain Engineering. I am currently employed in the Cognitive Intelligence Lab at KAIST. My research interest is computational neuroscience, which uses mathematical modeling to explain high-level cognitive functions. My current research utilizes deep visual neural networks to bridge the gaps between biological and computational visions.
