## About Me
Hi, my name is Minjun Kang. I graduated from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology ([KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr)) in August 2023. Currently, I am working at the [Cognitive Intelligence Lab](https://cogi.kaist.ac.kr) at KAIST. 

My research interests lies in the **<u>mathematical modeling of high-level cognitive functions</u>**. Specifically, I am fasinated by how the biological visual system differs from artificial vision in its adaptability and robustness under dynanmic environments, much like our natural world. You can find detailed research materials in the [Publications](/#papers) section.
