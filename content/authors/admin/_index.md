      â€¢ Study of human model-based (MB) reinforcement learning system using fMRI

      â€¢ Examine whether MB system would also use temporal difference to estimate
      drifting rewards and generate reward prediction error (MB-RPE)

      â€¢ Designed foraging tasks, conducted human behavioral experiments

      â€¢ Analyzed fMRI data, found significant MB-RPE signals from prefrontal cortex

## About Me
*In September 2025, I will begin my PhD in [Biological Sciences](https://biology.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/)!*

My research focuses on **<u>mathematical modeling of cognitive functions</u>**, exploring how the brain's unique representations emerge and give rise to complex behaviors. You can find more details in the [Publications](/#papers) section.

To learn more about me, feel free to explore the [Activities](experiences/) and [Hobbies](hobbies/) sections!
